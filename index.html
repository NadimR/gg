      <br> Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, and your existence will shape events during this pivotal moment in history.
       Also known for their quotes as :
      <br> "Where other men blindly follow the truth, 
      <br> Remember, nothing is true.
      <br> Where other men are limited by morality or law, 
      <br> Remember, everything is permitted.
      <br> We work in the dark to serve the light.
      <br> We are assassins.”
