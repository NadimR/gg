    <h1> <font color="white">Assassin's creed</h1>
    <div class= "intro">
      <h3> Introduction</h3>
    <p> The gameplay, while varying slightly from game to game,
      <br>falls in the historic action-adventure genre, with a 
      <br>heavy emphasis on stealth, combat and free-running.
    <br> You are an Assassin, stalking your prey with a hidden blade.
      <br> A warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your ruthlessness.
      <br> Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, 
      <br>and your existence will shape events during this pivotal 
      <br>moment in history. Also known for their quotes as :
      <br> "Where other men blindly follow the truth, 
      <br> Remember, nothing is true.
      <br> Where other men are limited by morality or law, 
      <br> Remember, everything is permitted.
      <br> We work in the dark to serve the light.
      <br> We are assassins.”

      <p> As you might know it already Altair was (in the serie) the first Assassin. 
        <br>Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad (1165 – 1257) was a Syrian-born member of the Levantine
        <br>Brotherhood of Assassins and served as their Mentor from 1191 until his death in 1257.
        <br>  During his tenure as Mentor, Altaïr made several discoveries and inventions that greatly
        <br> helped the Order's progression.
        <br> His leadership saw to the spread of the Assassins' influence in the Old World. 
        <br>And he try to save the population against the grovernment in place.
        <br> And as you might understood it is a bit the same objective for the others
        <br>assassins even if Edward kenway 
        <br> in Black Flag is mainly trying to get drunk and enjoy of his live.
